# Test app

Getting to know react hooks, my main goal is to make the app work as optimized as possible, using only functional components and avoiding useless rerenders with the help of hooks and memo.

## Current content

- hooks used:
[useState], [useReducer], [useContext]
- react features:
[React.memo]
- other:
[react-router-dom]

The app has a nav bar with a responsive menu that turns to a "burger menu" on smaller devices, a language toggle between english and spanish, and an about page. 
The app stores a language reference in the browser's local storage and gets the previously selected setting on load.

## npm start

Port is changed to 4200, http://localhost:4200.
